Christian here, this is my brain on code, specifically PowerShell.  I created this GitHub site as a learning tool to help me learn PowerShell, ARM templates in the Azure Cloud, and the integration of VS Code with GitHub.

Please visit my website: [THE CONTOSO] (https://thecontoso.com)

My Latest and most evolved PowerShell scripts are *"### The Learning Script ###"* series in the THECONTOSO repository, feel free to test them and provide feedback.  

I feel motivated and energized when I tackle complex script and work through it over hours or even days then have the eureka moment when it finally does exactly how I initially planned.

My newest project is auditing the MCW modules, correcting errors, uploading current photos and making sure the directions are clear.
