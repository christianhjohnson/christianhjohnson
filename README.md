Christian here, this is my brain on code, specifically PowerShell.  I created this GitHub site as a learning tool to help me learn PowerShell, ARM templates in the Azure Cloud, and the integration of VS Code with GitHub.

Please visit my website: [THE CONTOSO](https://thecontoso.com)

My Latest and most evolved PowerShell script is *[### The Learning Script ###](https://github.com/christianhjohnson/The-Contoso/blob/main/%23%23%23%20The%20Learning%20Script%20Vers%201.4%20%23%23%23.ps1)* series in the THECONTOSO repository, feel free to test them and provide feedback.  

I feel motivated and energized when I tackle complex script and work through it over hours or even days then have the eureka moment when it finally does exactly how I initially planned.

My other projects: 
* Auditing the MCW modules, correcting errors, uploading current photos and making sure the directions are clear.
* Creating 1 click deployment resources with ARM templates in Azure - see below
* Learning more about Linux through my deployment of Pi-Hole on a raspberry pi
* 

My First Deployment ARM :
